# Sustainability-Tracker
A chrome extension to easily trace the sustainability of the products you buy online

## How to Run
Simply download all files, extract the zip, go to manage extensions in chrome (I think developer tools need to be on), and upload unpacked. From there, go to any amazon.com product and click on the extension.

Due to some API issues, we had to hardcode some demo examples to test. Please try out these sites, if it does not work, try reloading and waiting.
